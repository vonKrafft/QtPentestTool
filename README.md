**QtPentestTool** is a GUI implemented in Python using PyQt5 (a C++ version will maybe come). The tool organizes the traces of a pentest, all the data of a project being stored in files and directories.

![GUI preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vonKrafft/QtPentestTool/master/preview.png)

The GUI displays the following information :
- Project's name and client
- Targets (URL, hostname and IP addresses)
- Accounts (usernames and passwords)
- Vulnerabilities list sorted by severity
- Vulnerability details, including CVSS score

## Features

- Generic (project-related) or vulnerability-specific screenshots
- Run custom commands or scripts (nmap, dirsearch, testssl, dnsrecon ...)
- CVSS v2 and v3 support
- Project and vulnerabilities data stored in JSON files
- Compress whole project folder when pentest is over

## Installation

You need `python3` and at least `scrot`, `urxvt` and `python3-pyqt5` to run **QtPentestTool**.

```
$ apt install scrot rxvt-unicode
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

To run customs commands or scripts, you have to install them too.
